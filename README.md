## üìä Project Overview

This project implements a hybrid recommendation system that combines content-based and collaborative filtering techniques. It recommends movies based on both the content of movies and user preferences.

### Import Libraries::
   - **pandas**: For handling and analyzing data.
   - **scikit-learn**: For calculating similarities between movies.
   - **numpy**: For numerical operations.

### Load Data::
   - Read three datasets: `movies.csv`, `tags.csv`, and `ratings.csv`. 
   - `movies.csv` contains movie details.
   - `tags.csv` contains movie tags.
   - `ratings.csv` contains user ratings for movies.

### Prepare Content-Based Filtering:
   - **Combine Tags and Genres**: Merge movie tags with movie genres to create a description for each movie.
   - **Compute Content Similarity**: Use TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to convert movie descriptions into numerical vectors and calculate how similar each movie is to every other movie based on these descriptions.

### Prepare Collaborative Filtering:
   - **Create User-Movie Matrix**: Make a matrix where rows represent users, columns represent movies, and cells contain ratings given by users.
   - **Filter Movies**: Ensure that only movies present in both the user-movie matrix and the content similarity matrix are used.
   - **Compute Collaborative Similarity**: Calculate how similar movies are based on user ratings.

### Hybrid Recommendation:
   - **Combine Scores**: Use both content-based and collaborative filtering scores to recommend movies. The `alpha` parameter controls the weight given to each type of score.
   - **Get Recommendations**: Sort movies by their combined score and return the top recommendations.

### Example Usage:
  - Call the function with a movie title and a user ID to get a list of recommended movies.
