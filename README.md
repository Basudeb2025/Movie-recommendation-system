      Happy to see you there, Wellcome to this repository here we will see the movie recommendation based on the rating , tags using content-based and collaborative filtering method. And using single KNN algorithm also.

## üìä Project Overview

This project implements a hybrid recommendation system that combines content-based and collaborative filtering techniques. It recommends movies based on both the content of movies and user preferences.

### Import Libraries::
   - **pandas**: For load, handling and analyzing data.
   - **scikit-learn**: For calculating similarities between movies.
   - **numpy**: For numerical operations.

### Load Data::
   - Read three datasets: `movies.csv`, `tags.csv`, and `ratings.csv`. 
   - `movies.csv` contains movie details.
   - `tags.csv` contains movie tags.
   - `ratings.csv` contains user ratings for movies.

### Prepare Content-Based Filtering:
   - **Combine Tags and Genres**: Merge movie tags with movie genres to create a description for each movie.
   - **Combine ratings and movies**: Merge movies and movies rating dataset to compute the neareset ratings movies.
   - **Compute Content Similarity**: Use TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to convert movie descriptions into numerical vectors and calculate how similar each movie is to every other movie based on these descriptions.

### Prepare Collaborative Filtering:
   - **Create User-Movie Matrix**: Make a matrix where rows represent users, columns represent movies, and cells contain ratings given by users.
   - **Filter Movies**: Ensure that only movies present in both the user-movie matrix and the content similarity matrix are used.
   - **Compute Collaborative Similarity**: Calculate how similar movies are based on user ratings.

### Hybrid Recommendation:
   - **Combine Scores**: Use both content-based and collaborative filtering scores to recommend movies. The `alpha` parameter controls the weight given to each type of score.
   - **Get Recommendations**: Sort movies by their combined score and return the top recommendations.

### Example Usage:
  - Call the function with a movie title and a user ID to get a list of recommended movies.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Scikit-learn, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Data Processing:** Pandas, NumPy
- **Modeling:** Scikit-learn
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook, Anaconda

## üåê Advantages and Disadvantages

  ### Advantages
- **Comprehensive Recommendations:** Combines content-based and collaborative filtering methods, making the recommendations more accurate and diverse.
- **Flexibility:** Adjusts the importance of content-based vs. collaborative scores with the alpha parameter.
- **Improved Accuracy:** Addresses the weaknesses of using either method alone, leading to better overall recommendations.

 ### Disadvantages
- **Complexity:** More complicated than using just one recommendation method.
- **Cold Start Problem:** New movies without enough tags or ratings may not be recommended effectively.
- **Resource Intensive:** Requires computation of similarities based on both content and user ratings, which can be resource-heavy.

### üöÄ Skills Gained

Through this internship and the development of this project, I have gained hands-on experience in:

- **Machine Learning:** Understanding and implementing various machine learning models.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning, transforming, and preparing data for analysis.
- **Feature Engineering:** Creating and selecting features that enhance model performance.
- **Model Evaluation:** Analyzing model performance using various metrics and fine-tuning hyperparameters.
- **Visualization:** Using data visualization tools to gain insights from data and model predictions.
- **Team Collaboration:** Collaborating with team members, using version control (Git), and documenting the project effectively.

### ‚è≥ Internship Experience

Over the course of this internship, I dedicated 8 weeks to developing this project. This experience significantly enhanced my understanding of advanced machine learning concepts, particularly content-based and collaborative filtering method.
